                <h2>skip if you don’t like intros</h2>
                <p>Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be
                    with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get
                    the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being
                    relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I
                    will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many
                    people I know.</p>

                <h2>let’s talk about the course</h2>
                <p>Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course. Here’s the link. It’s free. I
                    have embed the entire playlist below, you can watch it right here</p>

                <h2>rating 4/5</h2>
                <p>While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is little bit outdated.
                    Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for beginners.</p>


                <p><strong>pace</strong>
                    is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start
                    doozing</p>

                <p><strong>full screencast</strong>
                    of code, I like where I don’t have to see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things
                    on codepad. So, this was a huge +</p>

                <p><strong>great exampl</strong>
                    for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL.</p>
